[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> On average, first born children weigh less than other children: the total weight of first borns is 7.2 lbs and the others is 7.3 lbs. Cohen's d for the two groups is 0.088, which is not very large, indicating that the difference in weight between first borns and other babies is small. There is a greater difference beween pregnancy length (Cohen's d = 0.0288) of first and others, but that too is small.
